Inspired from the movie Goosebumps
Basically (a quick background of what happened in the movie Goosebumps), this author creates books about monsters but then they come to life. He finally "locks" them up in the book and the books are kept in a secret compartment
By doing so, no one will open the book to release the monsters. However, some teenagers found it an opened it. The author and the teens then scramble to write a new book so that they can lock the monster back into the 1 book. THE END (ofc they did lah)
 
So basically what happens in this mystery action story is that Ms Low will be somehow trapped inside the books. In order to save her and free her, we, her students, have to unlock the book where she is inside.
However(1G,Siyuan)But, there are her sayings locked inside the book with her. So the students bo bian have to open and try to trap the sayings into the book.
However, the book then gets ruined by the most scariest saying of hers, the 'aiyo boys the handwriting so bad next time how to caught(1G,Siyuan)court girls' saying... 
In the end, we seek help from the cat wizard (Char the cat hehe meow) and also Spikey. Together, we use our "powderful engrish unability" to write a whole book about it, hoping to lock the sayings back up in the new book.
However, Ms Low is slowly fading away, as someone secretly typed an extra line in the book. "and so did Ms Low..." Students of 1G hurriedly tries to rewrite that page, hoping to erase the sentence. 
In the end, it didnt work coz why not.  jkjk it worked Ms Low is savedddddddddddddddd YAYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!(1G,Siyuan) (by 1G and Char the cat hehe meow and also Spikey) 
I dont think Ms Low would dare to call spikey ugly again... or else... MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
